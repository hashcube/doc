## Hashcube DevKit

Hashcube offers two licensing options which are designed to be complementary, the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) and the [Hashcube Free License (GCFL)](http://www.Hashcube.com/GCFL-1.0.pdf). These licenses allow you to have source code access to the DevKit, but still release proprietary games. Youâ€™ll never have to pay us any money to use the DevKit under either of these options.

For complete licensing information please refer to the [license page](http://www.Hashcube.com/license.html) of the Hashcube website.
